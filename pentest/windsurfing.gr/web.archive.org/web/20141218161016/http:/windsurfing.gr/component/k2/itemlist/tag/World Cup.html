<div class="MsoNormal"><br/></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">A World Champion is crowned in Cabo Verde, but there’s no new king of Ponta Preta!</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">From the 15<sup>th</sup> through to the 23<sup>rd</sup> November the beautiful island of Sal played host to the world’s wavesailing elite for their grand finale of 2010. Having gone from strength to strength throughout the event’s three-year history, the fourth was expected to deliver conditions of the same epic proportions.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Unfortunately however, after the nine-day holding period was over just five man-on-man heats had been completed at the gnarly location of Curral Joul. This meant the rankings remained unchanged, and the 2010 Pozo champion, Victor Fernandez (Fanatic, North, MFC) claimed his first ever PWA wave world title ahead of three times former freestyle world champion, Ricardo Campello (JP, NeilPryde), and 2009 Pozo champion, Philip Koster (Starboard, NeilPryde, Dakine).</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><strong>Hottest Heats</strong></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Despite there not being an official result, the ten sailors who fought hard during the contest deserve a mention. The first to advance was the master of light wind wavesailing, Thomas Traversa (Tabou, Gaastra) who, having spent plenty of time seeking out similar wave perfection in Indonesia, stamped his authority on Yann Sorlut (RRD, Simmer) on day three.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">On the sixth day of competition Sal witnessed the all-British affair of Ross Williams (Tabou, Gaastra) battling it out with Jamie Hancock (Tabou, Vandal) for a place in the final 16. Hancock had far more waves, but in the final few seconds Williams caught the highest scoring ride of the entire day to help him advance.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">The next heat was an all-Venezuelan affair with Diony Guadagnino (Hot Sails, MFC) taking on current world number two, Ricardo Campello. Campello’s turns looked more impressive, but Guadagnino was busting out the aerials. It was a close run heat throughout, but in the end the judges gave it to Guadagnino – a godsend for Victor Fernandez in the race for the title, but a huge blow to the three time former freestyle world champion who had his sights set high.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Next to tiptoe their way off the rocks, and ride for their lives along the shore were Alex Mussolini (Tabou, Gaastra) and Jules Denel (Exocet). Denel put up an impressive fight, but with Mussolini launching into aerials over dry sections of rock, it was always going to be tough for the Frenchman to advance. In the end, the 2009 Sylt wave champion, Mussolini won by a convincing margin to secure his spot in the final 16.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">The final heat of the contest saw Canarian ripper, Dany Bruch (Patrik, Severne, AL360) pass ahead of German, Florian Jung (RRD, Gun, Dakine). After Jung’s first few waves, he spent a prolonged period stuck on the inside, unable to get back out until late in the heat, whilst Bruch racked up the points with some stylish top turns and a couple of aerials. Jung eventually made it back out, but by that time the wind had begun to decrease and the waves flattened off, leaving him with an almost impossible task in the dying minutes.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><strong>Casualties Of Curral Joul</strong></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">German, Florian Jung fell victim to the rocks on the sixth day of competition. Having completed his heat against Bruch, he was hotfooting it home when a wave washed in and forced his sail against his leg. The local doctors said he’d sustained multiple fractures and dislocations to his foot, ankle, and leg, so he flew home immediately to seek the best advice. From everyone here at the PWA, we wish him a speedy recovery.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><strong>The Waiting Game</strong></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">Aside from the two days that saw some windsurfing action, for the remainder of the week the sailors were seen sheltering from the sun in their cars at Curral Joul, or tearing the waves to pieces on their surfboards and SUPs.</div>

<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">Victor Fernandez claims his first ever PWA wave world title following a gruelling nine days on standby in Cabo Verde! </span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">In the hope of the conditions improving on the final day of competition head judge, Duncan Coombs scoured the island for the very last time, but the flat-calm seas and gentle breezes were in no way sufficient for the 2010 wave world title showdown. With little sign of either the wind or swell improving, the organisers decided to let the sailors relax for the entire day by calling off the competition at 09:00.</span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"> </span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">Having only completed five man-on-man heats throughout the week, the PWA’s finest leave Cabo Verde with no result.</span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">Without a result in Cabo Verde the world rankings remain the same as they were just nine days earlier, leaving 2010 Pozo champion, Victor Fernandez (Fanatic, North, MFC) to walk away with the 2010 PWA wave world title.</span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"> </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">Talking about his victory Fernandez said: “I’m super, super happy. I’ve put in a lot of work since my debut on the PWA World Tour, and a tremendous amount this year. It hasn’t really sunk in properly yet because of the long week we’ve had. I was expecting to come here and compete, so it’s been a bit disappointing that we haven’t. But, that’s the good thing about leading the rankings from the beginning of the year – you never know if an event will happen, so you have to make the most of it right from the start, which is exactly what I did, so I deserve to win. </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"> </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">I’m going to continue to train hard throughout the winter, whilst also filming our new movie, Second Life. I’m hoping to travel to some new places and perhaps return here on a good forecast to improve my wave riding. For the next few weeks I’m just going to head home though and celebrate with my family and friends, then I’ll be back next year to defend my title!”</span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"> </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">In second place, and possibly the luckiest man alive right now after his shock exit from the single elimination here on Saturday, is three times former freestyle world champion, Ricardo Campello (JP, NeilPryde, MFC). </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"> </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">Campello commented: “I’m really happy to have held onto my second place, if we’d have finished even just the first round, I probably would have lost it. Before the event I felt that I could challenge for the number one spot, but the conditions didn’t allow that. My goal this year was to finish in the top three, which I’ve achieved. </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"> </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">Now I’m going to head home and relax in Margarita for a bit - I’ve been away from there for a very long time. After that, I’ll probably come back here to Sal on a good forecast to film for the Second Life movie. I think my second place ranking this year will give me the motivation I need to train harder and go for the world title next year. The level is really high at the moment with lots of sailors capable of winning, but I’m going to give it my best shot!”</span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"> </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">Claiming the final podium position is the 2009 Pozo wave champion and teenage sensation, Philip Koster (Starboard, NeilPryde, Dakine). His incredible jumping has wowed the world on many occasions making him without doubt one of the sailors to watch out for in the future.</span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"> </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">Koster said of his 3<sup>rd</sup> place finish: “I just can’t believe it, it’s a dream come true. I’m really, really happy, especially after my bad luck last year in Sylt which put me down to 28<sup>th</sup>. I’m going to train as hard as I can this winter to improve my starboard tack jumping and waveriding, so hopefully next year I’ll be a more rounded sailor.”</span></span></div>

<p> </p>
<p>Brace yourself for the ultimate wavesailing finale at the world-renowned reef breaks of Ponta Preta and Little Ho'okipa!</p>
<p><strong>The PWA is proud to announce that the 2010 men's wavesailing final will take place on the island of Sal, Cabo Verde from the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">15th through to the 23rd November</span></strong>. And, will once again take the form of a roaming contest in order to make the most of the best possible conditions on offer.</p>
<p>Following three years of successful events on the island at the beginning of the competition season, the decision was made to move the event to the end of the world tour circuit in order to showcase the very best talent on the planet battling it out at one of the world's most hardcore spots, with the results being crucial for the year end ranking, and the crowning of the world champion.</p>
<p>High profile resident, and two times PWA world champion, Josh Angulo (Angulo, Gun) has played an instrumental part in making this incomparable wave final happen along with the event's main sponsor the Cape Verdian Investment Agency. And, despite Angulo announcing his retirement from official PWA wave competition last year, he'll no doubt want to make a one off appearance to bust out some of his notoriously high one handed aerials in front of his home crowds!</p>
<p>With just 32 places available, the second this news hits reef breaks across the globe, the PWA will be inundated with emails from the world's most radical unseeded wave sailors who'll all be eager for a wildcard position. These could potentially be filled by the most insane riders including former world champions, Jason Polakow (JP, NeilPryde), Francisco Goya, and Scott McKercher, starboard tack Ho'okipa legend Levi Siver (Dakine, MFC), board shaping master Keith Teboul (MFC), and many, many more... There have even been some rumors that the father of modern wavesailing, Mark Angulo may show up to ruffle some feathers.</p>
<p>The old guard won't have it easy though, they'll have to fight it out with the new cream of the crop including three times world champion, Kauli Seadi (JP, NeilPryde, MFC) who already has one Cabo Verde victory under his belt. Current tour leader, Victor Fernandez (Fanatic, North, MFC) will also be one to watch, as will Britain's Robby Swift (JP, NeilPryde), 2009 Sylt wave champion Alex Mussolini (Tabou, Vandal), former freestyle world champion Marcilio Browne (Fanatic, North), and French featherweight Thomas Traversa (Tabou, Gaastra) who have all finished in the top ten previously at this event.</p>
<p>After the first Cabo Verde wave contest, many of the PWA's top professionals said that the island produced some of the best wavesailing they'd ever experienced, and no one loves the spot more than Josh Angulo (Angulo, Gun) who had this to say:</p>
<p>"We're firing on all cylinders at the prospect of closing the 2010 season in Cabo Verde. Historically the biggest finals ever were in Hawaii and now Cabo Verde has jumped into the driver's seat with the billing of 'best windsurf spot in the world'. The mixture of wavesailing's legends clashing their epoxy swords with the PWA warriors of today should make for one of the heaviest showdowns of all time. The early winter period of November brings with it fresh 'alizes' breezes as well as pulsing Atlantic swells which combine for a lethal cocktail of 'Ponta Preta on the rocks'. I personally look forward to a one-off wave competition appearance and will have to buckle down to try and hold my top spot in the lineup, but most of all I look forward to once again welcoming the world, alongside Cape Verde Investimentos and Camara Do Sal, to the friendly islands of Cabo Verde."</p>
<p>Year upon year Sal has produced the goods, with the pumping Atlantic swells pulsating through the crystal clear waters to coincide perfectly with the trade winds in order to create the most extreme wavesailing playground, and an outstanding spectacle for the world to watch. This is an event not to be missed, and one that will be talked about time again, so get that date down in your diary now!</p>

<p>Micah Buzianis and Valerie Arrighetti claim victory in Turkey after a tense few days on standby saw them counting down the seconds until it was all over.</p>
<p>The beautiful Aegean town of Alacati blessed the world's fastest racers with an action packed few days of racing at the beginning of the week, followed by a couple of windless days on hold, leaving those in the lead to endure a nerve racking time before they could finally claim their crowns.</p>
<p>A full fleet of sixty-four professional sailors competed on the crystal clear waters in the men's fleet, and twenty-one fast and furious females in the women's. With a strong Meltemi breeze blowing, both the men and women completed two full rounds of racing on each of the first two days in perfect conditions. During the middle of the week a gentle southerly wind put a halt to proceedings, and on the final few days the Meltemi returned late in the afternoon, but with insufficient force to complete any further eliminations, leaving the four completed rounds to count.</p>
<p><strong>Men</strong></p>
<p><strong>Buzianis Bounces Back</strong></p>
<p>Following a fairly rough ride in Fuerteventura, former world champion Micah Buzianis (JP, NeilPryde) was back on form in Turkey with some amazingly consistent results normally reserved exclusively for his team mate, Antoine Albeau (JP, NeilPryde)!</p>
<p>Right from the word go Buzianis shot off the line and straight into the leading pack in every single heat. In the first race of the event he appeared to be far more comfortable in the lighter winds and flatter waters of Alacati, and a string of top two results saw him qualify for the winner's final with ease where he dominated despite a star-studded line up.</p>
<p>The second race of the series saw a new format with the top 20 automatically seeded through. The intention being that the less experienced sailors get more chances to race, and the top guys don't have to go through the formalities of the first round. Once again Buzianis sailed well despite the extra number of competitors in the heats and qualified for the winner's final without a glitch. However, plenty of other big players failed to do the same. Of the top five ranked sailors in the world, only two made it through the first mark carnage. Many times world champion, Bjorn Dunkerbeck (Starboard, Severne, Mystic), 2009 vice world champion Finian Maynard (RRD, Gaastra), and flying Frenchman Cyril Moussilmani (Starboard, North) all fell at the first hurdle in the new elimination procedure! This left a fairly clear path for Albeau and Buzianis to take the top two spots in the final, but after a mediocre start, Albeau was left to play catch up allowing Buzianis a straight run for another bullet - the American had finished the first day with the best possible start to the contest.</p>
<p>For the third race in Alacati race director, Juan Antonio Aragon decided to switch back to the tried and tested 8-man heat format due to the short course, and lighter winds that the sailors were experiencing. Buzianis played it fairly safe to ensure he qualified for the winner's final, and Albeau followed suit. When it came to the final however they both hit the water with all guns blazing. Albeau was back on unstoppable form, and surely hungry to seal the deal for his fifth consecutive slalom world title, leaving Buzianis to settle for second.</p>
<p>Race four saw another slalom giant with an appetite for success going by the name of Finian Maynard. His results thus far had been less than consistent, which surely psyched him up for the final. With a point to prove, he flew out of the blocks and straight into the lead where he remained for the duration. This left Buzianis to settle for another second, whilst Albeau fought hard for third.</p>
<p>Buzianis didn't quite match his perfect first day, but it wasn't far off! Two seconds had secured his place in the lead with Albeau and Maynard trailing in his wake.</p>
<p><strong>Tense Times</strong></p>
<p>The forecast didn't look too promising after the first two days, but the Meltemi was supposed to return in time for the weekend crowds, which left Buzianis comfortably leading the fleet and expecting more racing. However, after a long stint on standby on Friday, it became apparent that the racing might not recommence after all, and Buzianis could possibly win his first world tour crown of 2010.</p>
<p>Saturday dawned with a light Meltemi breeze firmly ensuring the sailors were on the edge of their seats for the entire day. It was a nerve-racking time for those at the top of the fleet who could only lose out by racing any further. After a grueling six hours on standby the first few heats finally began, but the pressure had already been lifted. With the possibility of only completing one race, Buzianis had the event in the bag. And, as it turned out the fifth race didn't get any further than the first round anyway before the wind disappeared causing it to be obsolete.</p>
<p><strong>Albeau Secures 2010 Title</strong></p>
<p>Despite not winning in Turkey, the 2009 world champion, Antoine Albeau has secured his fifth consecutive PWA slalom world title with an event to spare. He's consistently finished in the top two this season, and is now untouchable at the top - he doesn't even need to step on his board in Sylt! However, Albeau being Albeau he certainly will race in Germany, not only to stamp his authority on the fleet, but to also claim as much prize money as possible. Congratulations Antoine!</p>
<p><strong>What About Dunky...</strong></p>
<p>Following a mediocre start to the week due to his kit not arriving on time, and therefore having to beg, borrow, and steal for the first day - even though he arrived three days in advance to ensure it would all be there - he began the second day of competition with a discard under his belt already. He then ended up in an early round heat on the second day with five of the top eight ranked sailors in the world, leaving absolutely no room for error. Poor old Dunkerbeck got buried at the start with no way of coming back, and therefore had to count a terrible result. Worst-case scenario, he'll need a top three result to maintain his second place ranking for the year in Sylt.</p>
<p><strong>Standout Sailors</strong></p>
<p>Frenchman, Julien Quentel (RRD, NeilPryde) had an excellent event, being one of only three sailors to qualify for the finals (winner's and loser's) in every single race to finish the competition in fifth place. Now that a discard has come into effect in the overall rankings, and having not entered Korea, he's shot up to eleventh, and could easily break into the top ten if he repeats such a performance in Sylt.</p>
<p>Italian, Alberto Menegatti (Starboard, Simmer) also had one of the best events of his career to date, with a second place in the first race making him one to watch throughout the week. His seventh place finish in Alacati has lifted him into twelfth overall.</p>

<p><strong>Women</strong></p>
<p><strong>Outstanding Arrighetti</strong></p>
<p>The 2009 world champion, Valerie Arrighetti (Tabou, Loft, Mystic) sailed the most consistently out of all of her rivals on the first day of racing to place herself ahead of the pack, with a third in the first race behind current tour leader, Karin Jaggi (Patrik, Severne) and transatlantic hopeful, Sarah Hebert (Naish, Naish). And, a bullet in the final race of the day.</p>
<p>During day two, Arrighetti consolidated her position at the front of the fleet with yet another first place, and a second behind the 2010 freestyle world champion, Sarah-Quita Offringa (Starboard, Gaastra). The freestyle world champ was firing on all cylinders on the second day of competition, and had there been any more races could have been a real threat to those ahead of her, but she was desperately in need of a further discard after a less than ideal first day.</p>
<p>With just two days of racing, Arrighetti endured the same stress as Buzianis, with four nerve racking days on hold before she could finally claim her first crown of 2010.</p>
<p><strong>What About The Women's World Title?</strong></p>
<p>With four events now on the calendar, and more importantly a discard, most people believed that Arrighetti would have a shot at claiming the 2010 world title despite not entering Korea. However, close scrutiny of the PWA general rules (section 1.15.5 - Ties) has revealed that even if Arrighetti were to win in Almanarre and therefore match the current tour leader's counting results she would not be able to take the world title from her, as long as Jaggi actually enters Almanarre. This is because the tiebreak would go down to the sailor with the greater number of firsts, seconds, and so on. Which, at a glance looks like they'd have the same, but in actual fact Jaggi would have one higher score simply for entering the final in Almanarre compared to Arrighetti's non existent score for not entering Korea. Therefore, Jaggi's 2010 slalom world title is well within her grasp, and would only slip out if she fails to turn up in France!</p>

<p>Gollito busts out his best moves to bounce back to the top, whilst Offringa is crowned world champion once again.</p>
<p>After four days of testing conditions in the perfect freestyle playground of Lanzarote, three times world champion Jose 'Gollito' Estredo (Fanatic, North) and two times world champion Sarah-Quita Offringa (Starboard, Vandal) raise the silverware at the first stop of the PWA Canaries tour.</p>
<p>The intense week of world-class competition began with the wind refusing to blow on the opening day of competition for the forty-four professional sailors that congregated in Costa Teguise to battle it out at the Lanzarote World Cup.</p>
<p>On day two the bay became a freestyle Mecca allowing the heats to commence in perfect 15-20 knot winds. After a full day on the water the first round had almost drawn to a close, with just the finals left to run.</p>
<p>Day three proved to be a bit of a tease, with only enough wind to finish one heat. But, at least the thirty-five men were one step closer to finishing the single elimination.</p>
<p>On the final day the competitors awoke to a constant breeze allowing the heats to run on time, and the single elimination to draw to a close. By the end of the morning the champions had been crowned, but they had to wait the entire afternoon before they could celebrate. With just enough wind to start the double, Estredo and Offringa endured a nail biting few hours before the competition was eventually cancelled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Return Of Gollito</strong></p>
<p>From the very beginning the freestyle wonder kid, and 'Four Dimensions' star, Estredo held the upper hand on the rest of the fleet. Full of confidence due to previous Lanzarote victories, and with a new move in hand, he seemed unstoppable. Estredo exploded into action in the early rounds taking the scalp of anyone honored enough to sail in his heats, often claiming the holy grail of perfect tens from the judges. When it came to the final, he was well matched with Kiri Thode (Starboard, Gaastra), and many on the shore thought it was the end of his dominance. However, a faultless one-handed regular chachoo - technically the most difficult move in the book - launched the world champ back out in front and towards another victory.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Queen Of Freestyle</strong></p>
<p>No one ever doubted that the two times freestyle world champion, Sarah-Quita Offringa (Starboard, Vandal) would let her guard down and allow another competitor to pass. The young Aruban flew through her early heats with ease, and claimed her place in the winner's final after out styling Swiss freestyle flavour, Laure Treboux (Fanatic, North).</p>
<p>However, facing Venezuelan Yoli Freites De Brendt (Fanatic, North) in the final was not such a walk in the park. De Brendt had seriously stepped up her game, and was flying round tricks such as spock 540s and flakas right on cue. The heat was close throughout, but the world champion pulled out all of the stops in the second half, with a switch chachoo, one-handed spock 540, and a flaka diablo, putting to rest any thoughts of De Brendt becoming world champion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Surprises</strong></p>
<p>The level of the entire fleet has gone through the roof. The very first heat between Bjorn Saragoza (Starboard, Hot Sails) and Dalvis Parternina Teran (North, Fanatic) might just as well have been a final. They both pulled off technical combination moves that were last year only being landed by the top 3 sailors, and with more style than Gwen Stefani.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Best Newcomers</strong></p>
<p>Saragoza and Paternina Teran definitely deserve more than a mention. If the double had been able to develop, these two hot shots could easily have caused some upsets. In fact Saragoza already had. He took down the tour leader (at the time) Taty Frans (Starboard, MauiSails) in his second heat of the day. If you're into your betting, one of these would be worth a punt.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Move Of The Moment</strong></p>
<p>The newest creation from the triple world title holder, Estredo is the matador. It's basically a back to sail bob, but it looks extremely impressive all the same. Estredo unleashed the new move just before the competition began, which left many heading out in even the lightest of breezes to give it a go, and try to catch up with the master of tricks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Sailor Of The Week</strong></p>
<p>Apart from Estredo, Thode, and Tonky Frans (F2, Gaastra) who all performed impeccably well with stylish moves throughout their heats, the real tour regular that stood out this week was Canadian, Philip Soltysiak (Starboard, Dakine). He'd clearly been training hard throughout the winter, and it paid dividends in Costa Teguise.</p>
<p>The first top contender to bow out to Soltysiak was local port tack jumping specialist, Antxon Otaegui (JP, NeilPryde, MFC). The flat water, and lighter winds favoured the Canadian who nailed countless technically correct sliding moves to the dismay of Otaegui's home crowds.</p>
<p>He then moved into a head to head with new kid on the block, Saragoza. Some thought that this would signal the end of Soltysiak's run of glory, but he landed every move he's ever learnt, including a triple flaka which he admitted only landing just once before in his life. Needless to say, Soltysiak matched Saragoza and some, to move through into the semi-finals.</p>
<p>Despite a further display of outstanding flipping a sliding, Soltysiak failed to match Thode in the semi's, which meant he advanced to the loser's final. This again proved to be a great spectacle, but the Bonairean styler Tonky Frans edged ahead by the narrowest of margins leaving Soltysiak to settle for fourth. Still an awesome result in the toughest fleet in the world.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Rankings</strong></p>
<p><strong>Men - After two events</strong></p>
<p>Estredo's excellent performance has enabled him to pinch back his perch at the top of the rankings. Kiri's consistency sees him jump into second. But, a disastrous result here for Taty Frans sees him drop to 9<sup>th</sup>. However, if all of the events get a result then a discard will be allowed, which means that Taty could still claw his way back. The king of pop, Steven Van Broeckhoven (F2, Gaastra) slips into third.</p>

<p><strong>Women - Final 2010 freestyle rankings</strong></p>
<p>With only one event this year, the women's 2010 PWA freestyle world tour has already drawn to a close. Offringa has made it three in a row, and seems unstoppable at the top. De Brendt has stepped up her game, and with it a place in the rankings. And, Treboux's super stylish sailing sees her fight her way into third.</p>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">Prepare for breakneck speeds and cunning tactics as the PWAs fastest race fleets descend on Ulsans Jinha beach for the opening round of the 2010 slalom season.</span></span>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">From May 15<sup>th</sup> through to May 21<sup>st</sup> an elite group of windsurfers will battle it out around the buoys to make their mark on the first stop of the 2010 PWA slalom world tour. The beautiful beaches around the town of Ulsan will provide a dazzling backdrop to the fierce competition that will be taking place on the tropical waters of the Sea of Korea.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"><br/></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"><strong>Tipped For The Top</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">Men</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">We wouldnt expect anything less than for the undisputed champion of modern slalom, Antoine Albeau (JP, NeilPryde), to be firing on all cylinders and to clean up at yet another event. Hes dominated the racing scene in Korea for the past two years, and hasnt dropped out of the top 3 for as long as we can remember, so we doubt he will here.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"><br/></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">The only people to have knocked Albeau from the top spot at an event over the last four years, and have the serious potential to do it again, are British boy racer Ross Williams (Tabou, Gaastra) who beat him in Podersdorf last year, the terminator Bjorn Dunkerbeck (Starboard, Severne) who took honours from Albeau in 2008 at both Alactai and Sylt. And, Kevin Pritchard (Starboard, Gaastra, Dakine) and Micah Buzianis (JP, NeilPryde) who finished first and second respectively at the first ever PWA world cup in Ulsan during 2007, leaving Albeau to settle for third.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">Also in with a chance of claiming a place on the podium is heavyweight speedster, Finian Maynard (RRD, Gaastra). Following an impressive run of events towards the back end of last season, Maynard climbed the ranks to finish second overall. With a new sail sponsor to impress and plenty of determination, you can count on him hitting the racecourse hard this year, starting with Ulsan.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">Another name whispered through the wind is that of flying Frenchman, Cyril Moussilmani (Starboard, North). He notched up a few podium finishes last year, and weve been told by more than one source that hes up to speed and ready to make his mark.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"><br/></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">Women</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">The ongoing battle between Switzerlands amazingly successful world champion Karin Jaggi (Patrik Diethelm, Severne) and the fierce French champion Valerie Ghibadou (Tabou, Loft) finally tipped in Ghibadous favour last season, with her taking three straight bullets and the world title. As it stands, Ghibadou is yet to enter Korea, leaving the doors wide open for the legendary Jaggi to claim an early lead</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"><br/></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">That is if the likes of hardened young racer Sarah Herbert (Starboard, Naish sails) and freestyle world champion turned slalom racer Sarah-Quita Offringa (Starboard, Gaastra) allow her! Herbert had a successful season in 2009 scoring higher than Jaggi at the final event in Alacati, perhaps shell claim her first crown in Korea. Offringa entered just one round of racing last year, as a bit of taster, and finished ahead of both Jaggi and Herbert. Being used to toppling seasoned pros off the top spot surely makes Offringa a likely contender in Korea.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"><strong> </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"><strong>In it to win it</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">With a 55,000 prize purse up for grabs, expect high-octane explosive action whilst the very best sailors in the world push their boards to the limits around the fast and furious downwind slalom course.</span></span></p>

			  	<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"><strong>The 2010 PWA Surf World Cup Podersdorf - Event Preview</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">Gear up for some explosive action as the PWAs finest freestylers pile in to Podersdorf for the opening event of the 2010 windsurfing world tour</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">From April 30th through to May 5th the worlds best freestylers will congregate on the shores of Austrias Neusiedler See to show off all of the latest sail spinning and board sliding trickery in front of the huge crowds, world media, and of course the international judging panel.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"><br/></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"><strong>Movers and shakers</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">Weve heard via the grapevine that the current PWA freestyle world champion of Jose Gollito Estredo (Fanatic, North) has been putting in the hours on the water this winter and is firing on all cylinders. Hailing from the so-called freestyle capital of the world, a.k.a Margarita, Venezuela, hes a born and bred styler, and also a serious contender having claimed the overall world title on numerous occasions now.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">The boys from Bonaire will also be snapping at Estredos heels, and making the most of every opportunity they can in order to gain some points and take the overall title back to the Caribbean at the end of the year. Taty Frans (Starboard, MauiSails), Kiri Thode (Starboard, Gaastra), and Tonky Frans (F2, Gaastra) made it a 1,2,3 at the final event of 2009, where Thode very nearly stole the overall show from Estredo. All three of the sailors can pull off the latest moves on demand, and often throw them with a unique style that wins over both the crowds and the judges.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">Another name to watch is Steven Van Broeckhoven (F2, Gaastra). He put in a great performance last year, and is feared by the very best of his peers. Hes also got the advantage of being used to sailing in the cold, so we could see the young Belgian step it up a notch here.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">The only top 20 ranked sailor missing from the scene is the extremely talented 2007 PWA freestyle world champion, Marcilio Browne (Fanatic, North, MFC). After injuring his foot this winter hes decided to concentrate solely on the wave tour.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"><br/></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"><strong>In it to win it</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">With a 30,000 prize purse up for grabs, expect the very best sailors to be pushing the limits with as yet, unseen in competition, combination moves thatll blow both the pros and rookies off the water.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">With a slight change to the PWA rule book, this season competitors will only be allowed to compete on models of production board that have been registered with the PWA.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"><br/></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"><strong>Shore side</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">World renowned for its huge parties, and beach side activities, the Surf World Cup Podersdorf is bound to set the tour alight, and get the season going with a bang. If youre looking for a festival atmosphere, mixed in with some extreme windsurfing competition at the highest level, this really is an event not to be missed. We guarantee youll be psyched up for the season after watching these guys strut their stuff.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"><br/></span></span></p>

			  	<p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;">Antoine Albeau and Valerie Ghibaudo are crowned as the 2009 Costa Brava  Champions, both taking decisive wins to establish their positions at the top of  the PWA Slalom World Tour. Despite an unfavorable forecast Costa Brava delivered  enough wind to provide a spectacular full round of slalom for both men's and  women's fleets and climaxed with thrilling action right up to the semi finals of  round two.<br/><br/>Round 3 of the PWA World Tour Slalom took place in the  beautiful Costa Brava region of Catalunya, Spain. Set on the Ballena Alegre  Camping resort inside the Bay of Roses, it was a slalom sailing paradise ready  to test the world's best, men and women slalom racers.<br/>Action began instantly  as the thermal sea breeze kick-started the event on day one. Two heats were held  on a giant four-gybe slalom course. The huge reaches leading to spectacular  speed battles as sailors topped 30kts, a real test of strength and  equipment.<br/><br/>From the outset it looked like all the major players meant  business, with all the top seeds advancing easily into the quarter finals along  with un-seeded standout "sailor of the day" Damien Le Guen (JP/NeilPryde) of  France.<br/><br/>Day 2 continued where Day 1 had left off. Another huge course  meant drag racing reaches, as once again the top seeds moved to the next round,  proving that they had earned their rightful places in the PWA  rankings.<br/><br/>Quarterfinals <br/>At this point the competition started to heat  up with the standard jumping through the roof. The difficult light and gusty  winds meant any mistakes were cruelly punished.<br/>Kevin Pritchard  (Starboard/Gaastra/Dakine) was the first big name to fall when his outhaul rope  exploded, leaving his title hopes floating in the Mediterranean. Number 3 seed  Gonzalo Costa Hoevel (Exocet/MauiSails) also exited at the quarter finals. A  crucial over early put him out of the running before the race had even  started.<br/><br/>All the sailors on the staring grid in the semi finals had the  ability to win a final, but only the top 4 qualifiers would even be given the  opportunity. First to fall was Bjorn Dunkerbeck (Starboard/Severne). Winning all  his previous heats he made a poor decision to change fins, losing power and  failing to advance. <br/><br/>Semi final 2 saw an on-fire Peter Volwater  (F2/MauiSails) lead off the start. The powerful Antoine Albeau (JP/NeilPryde)  had a point to prove and reeled him in, taking the win and giving everyone a  clear indication of his intentions.<br/><br/>The finals<br/>Dunkerbeck made no  mistakes in the losers final, asserting his authority on the pack with a  masterful display. Patrik Diethelm (F2/North Sails) followed on his tail taking  second by a comfortable margin, ahead of Josh Angulo (Angulo/MauiSails) in  3rd.<br/><br/>The much anticipated winner's final saw a thrilling conclusion to  Race 1. Off the start it was Steve Allen that took control and arrived at the  first gybe in first place by half a board length. Right on his tail were Micah  Buzianis (JP/NeilPryde) and Antoine Albeau - both attacking for that number one  slot. Antoine muscled his way through the gybe, exiting in a dominant position.  Meanwhile as the three fought to hold their ranking, Ross Williams  (Tabou/Gaastra) capitalized on the battle, sailing high, keeping out of trouble  and then moved into attack position on the outside gybe approach. Antoine held  onto first, Williams moved into 2nd and Allen just about held off Buzianis out  and out challenge to take 3rd. <br/><br/>Women's Race 1<br/>The standard of the  women's fleet has risen dramatically and this event saw 16 competitors of the  highest level. Even more impressive is the amount of youth in the fleet showing  how promising the future looks for women's racing. <br/>First round standout was  Alice Arutkin (Starboard/North Sails). She blasted into 1st place ahead of World  Champion Karin Jaggi (F2/Severne). At just 17 years old she is definitely a hot  tip for the future. Unfortunately for her a timing mistake in the final meant  she eventually finished 6th.<br/><br/>The women's finals<br/>The loser's final was  won by fired up French woman Morane Demont (Starboard/Severne). Demont had an  over-early in the first round, but made no mistakes in the losers' final.  Celebrating her 16th birthday midweek, she is surely another high hope for the  future. Çagla Kubat (Starboard/North Sails) looked very comfortable on the water  and took 2nd. A winter in Maui, training with Jimmy Diaz, was clearly paying  off. In 3rd position young Turkish hope Lena Erdil (Starboard/The Loft) was  fuming. She had been leading an earlier heat when it was cancelled and in the  re-run things did not go the same way. Sometimes racing can be very  cruel.<br/>The final was a more traditional affair with Valerie Ghibaudo  (Tabou/The Loft) and Karin Jaggi both fighting it out for the top spot. A minor  starting error from Karin opened the door for Valerie and she made no mistake  taking advantage dominating the race from start to finish. In 3rd place was a  surprised Marta Hlavaty (Starboard/MauiSails). More at home on the Olympic RSX  board, she used her light wind skills to work through the lulls and move into  the final podium position.<br/><br/>Men's Race 2<br/>No wind on day 3 gave sailors  time to reflect, but they were back in action by day 4 as the afternoon wind  switched back on. Race 2 was run on a much shorter course, favoring the lighter  guys who accelerated rapidly out of the gybes. <br/>Early round stand out was  Frenchmen Pierre Mortefon (JP/NeilPryde) who sailed brilliantly to not only pass  through round one, but continue onwards all the way to the semi-final. At only  19 years old, and with relatively little PWA experience, he showed great promise  and earned himself the title of "PWA Sailor of the day" in the  process.<br/>Marcus Pöltenstein (Fanatic/NeilPryde) was also flying. In heat 3 he  held off a turbo charged Finian Maynard (RRD/NeilPryde) and had it not been for  an over early in the quarterfinal, could have gone further. When asked what went  wrong with the start he commented, "My speed was too good, I was just going too  fast!"<br/><br/>Quarterfinals<br/>The level went through the roof as they raised  the green flag for the first quarterfinal heat. The pressure was on with any  mistake a potential disaster for the big guns. <br/>First to falter was Josh  Angulo. He was a casualty of Mortefon's run, finishing in 5th place and missing  out on the all-important place in the semis. Cyril Moussilmani (Starboard/North  Sails) and Arnon Dagan (Tabou/Gaastra) were deprived a position in the next  round when they jumped the gun over early and were forced to enviously watch  their heats from the beach.<br/>Jimmy Diaz (Starboard/North Sails) seemed to be  on a mission at this point. His smooth gybes were paying off on the shortened  course and he dominated his first two heats, comfortably moving into the top 16.  Also showing promise was Robby Swift (JP/NeilPryde). After a poor start to the  season at the first two events, he had a score to settle and sailed aggressively  though to the semis.<br/><br/>Semi-Finals<br/>With the tension building for the  semi finals, the wind was already starting to back off, making for some of the  most testing conditions so far this year. Consistency was rewarded and mistakes  punished. <br/><br/>The first semi final saw a tight battle down the first reach.  Finian Maynard (RRD/NeilPryde) used his incredible board speed to hit the gybe  mark first, but it was Steve Allen who came out on top, blitzing a trail to  victory. Julien Quentel (RRD/NeilPryde) seemed to reveling in the light  conditions and he too moved ahead of Maynard, booking his place in the ultimate  heat. Maynard held onto third place, but the real battle was occurring in his  wake. After a dreadful start from Kevin Pritchard (Starboard/Gaastra) he leveled  with Diaz and the two Starboard riders scrapped their way around the course  until finally Diaz used his gybing prowess to gain an advantage and hammer home,  sealing the final qualifying slot.<br/><br/>By the time semi final two was under  starting orders, the wind was hovering around the minimum limit. Nevertheless it  was the large frames of Antoine Albeau and Bjorn Dunkerbeck that rounded the  mark first. Albeau made it through cleanly but behind him, the rest of the fleet  stalled at the gybe. Peter Volwater and Micah Buzianis were first to break away,  pumping furiously and leaving the remaining sailors wallowing behind. Dunkerbeck  managed to hold onto the fourth slot, but the pack were gathering like hungry  wolves as the big man worked hard to stay moving. Unfortunately for the top 4,  but fortunately for the back four, the N flag was hoisted, signifying the  cancellation of the heat.<br/><br/>Women Race 2<br/>On standby for much of the  afternoon, Women's heat one hit the water between the two men's semi finals. In  an almost identical repeat of the Race one results, Alice Arutkin shot into the  lead off the start, leaving Karin Jaggi trailing hot on her heals. The young  French girl extended her lead in the light breeze, winning the heat comfortably.  Karin cruised into second and Marta Hlavaty continued her consistent performance  in third. Taking the final qualifying spot was Fanny Aubet (JP/NeilPryde) who  held off a strong challenge from the flying Turk Lena Erdil.<br/><br/>Waiting  Game<br/>The waiting game was the name of days 5 and 6. Despite promising  forecasts the wind teased the competitors, hovering around the minimum  throughout the weekend. However there was still plenty of action on the Ballena  Alegre campsite. With both a windsurf trade exhibition and huge Volkswagen  rally, there was something for everyone as the weekend crowd descended upon the  race site to soak up the carnival atmosphere, rub shoulders with the stars and  prepare for the evening extravaganza on the beach. The PWA's live ticker  completed the action with live chats and plenty of informative insight to what  goes on both on the races course and behind the scenes.<br/><br/>The final day of  the 2009 PWA Costa Brava World Cup summarized the frustrating week of waiting.  With a solid forecast, all hope was for one last blast of action to cap off the  event with some late drama. All the ingredients were in place for a grand  finale, but as the wind filled in high-level cloud moved into town, shutting  down the breeze, and leaving the likes of Ross Williams teetering on the edge of  breakdown.<br/>Williams started the day, sitting in the nasty position of having  everything to lose and nothing to gain. Competition could only mean one thing  for the English high flyer: Having already lost his semi final heat the previous  day, one more completed heat would have seen him drop from 2nd to 8th.  Fortunately for the British racer, despite numerous attempts to finish the  second round, race director Juan Antonio Aragon eventually was forced to call it  a day in failing conditions.<br/>Ross Williams: "It has been a very stressful 12  hours, but it feels amazing now it is all over. In the morning I thought we  would be racing and had dealt with it in my mind, but as the day went on and the  chance of no action increased, it was really hard. The last hour of waiting was  absolute torture!"<br/>So Antoine Albeau and Valerie Ghibaudo took the Costa  Brava Champions title, both celebrating back-to-back victories and cementing  their positions at the top of the ranking. When asked how she felt, the answer  was typical of the French speed queen.<br/>Valerie Ghibaudo "'appy, 'appy, 'appy.  It's my second win and puts me in a very good position for the overall tour.  Last year I did really badly in Costa Brava, so it's nice to come back this year  and win."<br/>Antoine as always remained philosophical as ever:<br/>Antoine Albeau  "It was hard for everyone. In that sort of racing it is so easy to make  mistakes. Looking back, I am really happy to have won that first round!<br/>I am  happy with the first 3 events. With new boards and low winds it is good to know  I am going well in the light stuff. Now we move into the windy part of the tour  so it will be interesting to see how everyone is going in that.<br/>I feel some  pressure now from Ross, but there are also lots of other guys that can still do  really well. Its still just the beginning!"<br/>The PWA crew now move on to  Lanzarote, for Round 1 of the PWA freestyle world tour, which is shaping up for  an explosive start to the season. Stay tuned to the PWA web site to find out who  will emerge victorious. Join the action from the 30th June. <br/>For a full list  of results, the PWA photo gallery and much more, check out  www.pwaworldtour.com.<br/><br/><strong>Final Event results</strong><br/><strong>Men</strong>:<br/>1st Antoine Albeau  (JP/NeilPryde)<br/>2nd Ross Williams (Tabou/Gaastra)<br/>3rd Steve Allen<br/>4th  Micah Buzianis (JP/NeilPryde)<br/>5th Jimmy Diaz (Starboard/North Sails)<br/>6th  Finian Maynard (RRD/NeilPryde)<br/>7th Peter Volwater (F2/MauiSails)<br/>8th Bjorn  Dunkerbeck (Starboard/Severne)<br/>9th Robby Swift (JP/NeilPryde)<br/>10th Sylvain  Moussilmani (Starboard/Simmer Style)<br/><br/><strong>Women</strong>:<br/>1st Valerie Ghibaudo  (Tabou/The Loft)<br/>2nd Karin Jaggi (F2/Severne)<br/>3rd Marta Hlavaty  (Starboard/MauiSails)<br/>4th Sarah Hebert (Starboard/Naish)<br/>5th Lise Vidal  (Exocet/North Sails)</span></p>

<title>2009 PWA Ulsan World Cup - Day 1</title>
<span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>2009 PWA Ulsan World  Cup<br/> <br/></strong><em>Day 1: The slalom fleet register for battle at Jinha  Beach.<br/> <br/></em>Competition’s opening day kicked off with the registration of  both the men and women’s slalom fleets. In total, the men’s fleet saw 42  competitors register, which included a healthy contingent of local Japanese and  Korean sailors. <br/> <br/>The women’s fleet had 10 sailors register for the  ensuing six days of race action, which also included a strong force of local  talent.<br/> <br/>Following registration, race one had been scheduled to begin at  2.00pm, however the weather refused to play ball. Rain, overcast skies and dead  calm waters meant competition had to be placed on standby for the duration of  the afternoon, until the race committee officially called off day one at 4.30pm.  <br/> <br/>This evening will see the official opening of the event, which will  commemorate the third anniversary of the PWA Ulsan World Cup with a selection of  speeches, set to a traditional backdrop of Korean food and music. <br/> <br/>The  outlook for the competition looks very promising, with ample wind forecast for  the days ahead. Kicking day two off, the skippers meeting is scheduled for  9.00am, with a first possible start to racing at 9.30am.
